### 访问AWS

To access AWS Cloud services, you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS

Command Line Interface \(CLI\), or the AWS Software Development Kits \(SDKs\).

The AWS Management Console is a web application for managing AWS Cloud services. The

console provides an intuitive user interface for performing many tasks. Each service has its

own console, which can be accessed from the AWS Management Console. The console also

provides information about the account and billing.

The AWS Command Line Interface \(CLI\) is a unified tool used to manage AWS Cloud

services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple services

from the command line and automate them through scripts.

The AWS Software Development Kits \(SDKs\) provide an application programming interface

\(API\) that interacts with the web services that fundamentally make up the AWS platform.

The SDKs provide support for many different programming languages and platforms to allow

you to work with your preferred language. While you can certainly make HTTP calls directly

to the web service endpoints, using the SDKs can take the complexity out of coding by

providing programmatic access for many of the services.
