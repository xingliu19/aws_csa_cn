\[Amazon SQS\], Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront\)

Domain 2.0: Implementation/Deployment

2.1 Identify the appropriate techniques and methods using Amazon Elastic

Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\), Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\),

AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CloudFormation, AWS OpsWorks, Amazon

VPC, and AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) to code and

implement a cloud solution.

Content may include the following:

Operate and extend service management in a hybrid IT architecture.

Configure services to support compliance requirements in the cloud.

Launch instances across the AWS global infrastructure.

In 2006, Amazon Web Services, Inc. \(AWS\) began offering IT infrastructure

services to businesses in the form of web services, now commonly known as cloud

computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace up-front

capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business. With the

cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure

weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of

servers in minutes and deliver results faster.

Today, AWS provides a highly reliable, scalable, and low-cost infrastructure platform in the

cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in more than 190 countries around

the world.

This chapter provides an introduction to the AWS Cloud computing platform. It discusses the

advantages of cloud computing and the fundamentals of AWS. It provides an overview of the

AWS Cloud services that are fundamentally important for the exam.
